          Best known for his cerebral, often nonlinear, storytelling, acclaimed
          Academy Award winner writer/director/producer Sir Christopher Nolan
          CBE was born in London, England. Over the course of more than 25 years
          of filmmaking, Nolan has gone from low-budget independent films to
          working on some of the biggest blockbusters ever made and became one
          of the most celebrated filmmakers of modern cinema.</p>

          <p class="kk">At 7 years old,Nolan began making short films with his father's Super-8 camera. While
          studying English Literature at University College London, he shot
          16-millimeter films at U.C.L.'s film society, where he learned the
          guerrilla techniques he would later use to make his first feature,
          Following (1998), on a budget of around $6,000. The noir thriller was
          recognized at a number of international film festivals prior to its
          theatrical release and gained Nolan enough credibility that he was
          able to gather substantial financing for his next film.</p>

          <p class="kk">Nolan's second film was Memento (2000), which he directed from his own screenplay
          based on a short story by his brother Jonathan Nolan. Starring Guy
          Pearce, the film brought Nolan numerous honors, including Academy
          Award and Golden Globe Award nominations for Best Original Screenplay.
          Nolan went on to direct the critically acclaimed psychological
          thriller, Insomnia (2002), starring Al Pacino, Robin Williams and
          Hilary Swank.</p>

          <p class="kk">The turning point in Nolan's career occurred when he was
          awarded the chance to revive the Batman franchise in 2005. In Batman
          Begins (2005), Nolan brought a level of gravitas back to the iconic
          hero, and his gritty, modern interpretation was greeted with praise
          from fans and critics alike. Before moving on to a Batman sequel,
          Nolan directed, co-wrote, and produced the mystery thriller The
          Prestige (2006), starring Christian Bale and Hugh Jackman as magicians
          whose obsessive rivalry leads to tragedy and murder.</p>
          <p class="kk">In 2008, Nolan directed, co-wrote, and produced The Dark Knight (2008). Co-written
          with by his brother Jonathan, the film went on to gross more than a
          billion dollars at the worldwide box office. Nolan was nominated for a
          Directors Guild of America (D.G.A.) Award, Writers Guild of America
          (W.G.A.) Award and Producers Guild of America (P.G.A.) Award, and the
          film also received eight Academy Award nominations. The film is widely
          considered one of the best comic book adaptations of all times, with
          Heath Ledger's performance as the Joker receiving an extremely high
          acclaim. Ledger posthumously became the first Academy Award winning
          performance in a Nolan film. </p>

          <p class="kk">In 2010, Nolan captivated audiences with
          the Sci-Fi thriller Inception (2010), starring Leonardo DiCaprio in
          the lead role, which he directed and produced from his own original
          screenplay that he worked on for almost a decade. The
          thought-provoking drama was a worldwide blockbuster, earning more than
          $800,000,000 and becoming one of the most discussed and debated films
          of the year, and of all times. Among its many honors, Inception
          received four Academy Awards and eight nominations, including Best
          Picture and Best Screenplay. Nolan was recognized by his peers with a
          W.G.A. Award accolade, as well as D.G.A. and P.G.A. </p>        </p>
